# SFJAZZ Live Shows Ticket Sales Data Prediction

## Abstract
This study investigates the determinants of live show ticket sales at SFJAZZ, with a particular focus on the impact of digital marketing campaigns. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2020 to present, we employ data engineering techniques and statistical analysis to develop a predictive model for ticket sales. Our research aims to provide empirically-based insights to inform marketing strategies and operational decision-making in the performing arts sector.

## Methodology
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. Aggregation of daily digital marketing campaign data with a one-month lag to account for delayed effects
2. Integration of membership history with ticket sales data
3. Construction of variables including ad spend, subscription levels, and various purchase attributes

### Statistical Analysis
1. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to explore data characteristics
2. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to quantify the impact of various factors on ticket sales

## Key Findings
1. Statistically significant positive correlation between Monthly Digital membership and ticket sales
2. Strong association between multiple seat purchases and increased ticket sales
3. Limited impact of ad spend and online purchases on ticket sales
4. Absence of significant seasonal effects on ticket sales patterns

## Implications
Our findings suggest that SFJAZZ's digital membership program serves as an effective platform for audience engagement and ticket sales promotion. The strong correlation between multiple seat purchases and sales indicates a preference for group attendance, which could inform pricing and marketing strategies.

## Limitations and Future Research
The current model explains 13.4% of the variability in ticket sales, indicating the presence of additional influential factors not captured in this study. Future research directions include:

1. Incorporation of Google Ads data and artist/genre metadata
2. Application of advanced time series analysis techniques
3. Investigation of additional socio-economic and cultural factors influencing ticket sales

## Technical Implementation
- Data manipulation and analysis: Python (pandas, numpy)
- Statistical modeling: statsmodels
- Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
